      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a collection of all of the handshakes that Paul Hollywood has given to contestants across all
        seasons of the Great British Bake Off.
      </p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        As season 9 started, it became apparent that these handshakes were being given out far too frequently. There
        wasn&apos;t a place where it was clear how many had been given out and when, so I decided that I would create such a
        place, partly for fun, partly for learning and partly for documentation of the handshakes.
